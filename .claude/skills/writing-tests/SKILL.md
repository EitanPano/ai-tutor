description: Write or review unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Use when adding tests for a new feature, writing a regression test for a bug fix, deciding what needs coverage, or judging whether a test suite is good enough to ship. Covers required coverage areas, test structure, fixtures, flakiness rules, and PR expectations.

# Writing Tests

Applies to unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Principles
- Test **behavior**, not implementation details.
- Keep tests deterministic and isolated.
- Fast feedback first: unit tests, integration where needed, e2e for critical flows.
- Every bug fix gets a test when feasible.

## Must be covered
- Domain logic and state transitions.
- API request validation and error responses.
- Auth and org boundary enforcement.
- Persistence-critical paths and migration-sensitive queries.
- User-facing failure flows for key features.

## Structure
- Clear setup → action → assertion phases.
- Descriptive names that state the expected behavior.
- One primary assertion intent per test.
- No shared mutable state between tests, and no reliance on execution order.

## Data and fixtures
- Minimal fixtures, focused on the scenario.
- Prefer factories/builders over large static fixtures.
- Never embed real secrets, keys, or credentials in test data.

## Reliability
- No flaky tests on mainline branches.
- Mock only unstable external dependencies.
- Freeze or override time and randomness when behavior depends on them.

## PR expectations
- New features ship with a happy-path **and** a failure-path test.
- Bug fixes ship with a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- Update or delete obsolete tests when behavior changes intentionally.

## This repository

| Suite | Location | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `frontend/tests/unit/` | `cd frontend && bun run test` (Vitest + RTL, jsdom) |
| E2E | `frontend/tests/e2e/` | `cd frontend && bun run test:e2e` (Playwright, chromium) |
| Backend | `backend/` | `cd backend && bunx vitest run` — only when `backend/` exists |

Use `bun run test`, never `bun test`: `bun test` starts Bun's built-in runner, which
ignores the Vitest config and setup files.

Vitest runs with `globals: false`, so import explicitly:
`import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest"`.

When a test fails, fix the code — not the test.
